##  Library Management System – DSA

This exercise demonstrates the use of **linear** and **binary search** to find books in a library system.

### Files:
- `Book.java` – Represents a book with title, author, and ID
- `Library.java` – Contains linear and binary search methods
- `Main.java` – Test the implementation

### Search Types:
| Search     | Time Complexity | Sorted Data Required |
|------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Linear     | O(n)             | No                    |
| Binary     | O(log n)         | Yes                   |

### Recommendation:
Use **Binary Search** when working with **large sorted datasets** for faster performance.
