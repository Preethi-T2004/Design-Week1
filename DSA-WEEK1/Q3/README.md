## Q3: Sort Customer Orders – DSA

This project demonstrates sorting customer orders by `totalPrice` using:
- Bubble Sort (simple, stable)
- Quick Sort (fast and efficient for large datasets)

### Files:
- `Order.java` – Represents customer orders
- `SortAlgorithms.java` – Contains Bubble Sort and Quick Sort
- `Main.java` – Runs both sorts and displays results

### Time Complexity:
| Algorithm     | Best   | Average | Worst  |
|---------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Bubble Sort   | O(n)   | O(n²)   | O(n²)  |
| Quick Sort    | O(n log n)| O(n log n)| O(n²) |

### Recommendation:
Quick Sort is preferred for large, unsorted data due to better average-case performance.
