## Q10: MVC Pattern - Student Records Web App

This project demonstrates the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern using a basic student record management system.

### Components:
- `Student.java`: Model that holds student data
- `StudentView.java`: View that displays student information
- `StudentController.java`: Controller that updates model and refreshes the view
- `Main.java`: Demonstrates the flow

### Use Case:
Allows separation of business logic, data, and UI for better modularity and maintainability.
